This project develops machine learning models to predict whether a movie will get a blockbuster status based on pre-release metadata. Using the IMDb Top 5000 Movies dataset, three classification algorithms were implemented: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Movies grossing at least 100 million dollars were classified as blockbusters. Gradient Boosting achieved the highest performance with an ROC-AUC of 0,9189, showing strong discriminatory ability despite significant class imbalance in the dataset.
